====== Decision Matrix ======

The full functionality of the decision matrix is explained [[http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpspec/doku.php?id=decision_matrix|in the specification]]. 

Beijing have a decision matrix consisting of eight entries. This matrix can be used to control the I/O channels. Possible actions are listed in the table below.

^ Action ^ Action code ^ Parameter ^Description ^
|  **NOOP**  |  0  |  Not used  | No operation. Will do absolutely nothing. |
|  **SET**  |  1  |  Channel (0-9)  | Set output of I/O channel high.\\ \\ Set the output of the I/O channel given by the argument to its high state. The argument is an integer where 0 is output 0 and so on and can be in the range 0-9. |
|  **CLR**  |  2  |  Channel (0-9)  | Set output of I/O channel low.\\ \\ Set the output of the I/O channel given by the argument to its low state.\\ The argument is an integer where 0 is output 0 and so on and can be in the range 0-9. |
|  **PULSEON**  |  3  |  Channel (0-9)  | Turn on pulse on output I/O channel\\ \\ Turn on pulse output on the output I/O channel given by the argument. The argument is an the range 0-9. Does not have any meaning for a channel set as input. |
|  **PULSEOFF**  |  4  |  Channel (0-9)  | Turn off pulse on output I/O channel\\ \\ Turn off pulse output on the output I/O channel given by the argument. The argument is an integer where 0 is output 0 and so on and can be in the range 0-9. Does not have any meaning for a channel set as input. |
|  **TOGGLE**  |  5  |  Channel (0-9)  | Toggle output for channel\\ \\ Toggle output four output I/O channel given by argument. The argument is an integer where 0 is output 0 and so on and can be in the range 0-9. Does not have any meaning for a channel set as input. |
|  **STATUS**  |  6  |  Channel (0-9)  | Send status for I/O channel.\\ \\ Send status for an I/O channel given by the argument. The argument is an integer where 0 is output 0 and so on and can be in the range 0-9.\\ For a channel set as output the status is the output applied and for a channel set as input the actual input state. |
|  **STATUSALL**  |  7  |  Not used  | Send status for all I/O channels.\\ \\ Send status for all I/O channels starting with channel 0 and then taking each channel up to channel 9. |
|  **SHORTPULSE**  |  8  |  Channel (0-9)  | Send a short pulse, with a duration set in register 0:47, on the selected output(s). |

===== Example =====

You want to activate output on channel 3 when a [[http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpspec/doku.php?id=class1.control#type_5_0x05_turnon|CLASS1.CONTROL, TurnOn, Type=5 event]] is received.  

A matrix row consist of

^ Byte ^ Description ^
| 0 | oaddr |
| 1 | flags |
| 2 | class-mask |
| 3 | class-filter |
| 4 | type-mask |
| 5 | type-filter |
| 6 | Action code |
| 7 | Action parameter |


So for example if you populate the row with the following values

^ Byte ^ Value ^ Description ^
|  0  |  **0x00**  | oaddr |
|  1  |  **0x80**  | flags |
|  2  |  **0xff**  | class-mask |
|  3  |  **0x1e**  | class-filter |
|  4  |  **0xff**  | type-mask |
|  5  |  **0x05**  | type-filter |
|  6  |  **0x01**  | Action code |
|  7  |  **0x02**  | Action parameter |


  * **oaddr** set to zero as i is not used.
  *  **flags** have one bit set. Enable row. We could have set bit 4 Match Zone to  test zone also trigger DM.
  * **class-mask** is set to 0xff as we have just one event we will trigger on.
  * **class-filter** is set to CLASS1.CONTROL.
  * **type-mask** is set to 0xff as we have just one event we will trigger on.
  * **type-filter** is set to 5 which is TurnOn.
  * **Action code** i set to the SET action.
  * **Action parameter**  2 is channel 2 so this channel will be set high if configured as an output.



If you double click a decision matrix row a dialog comes up which help you to set the values.
